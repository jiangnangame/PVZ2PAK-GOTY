PVZ2PAK:GOTY, also <i>Plants vs. Zombies 2 PAK: Game of the Year</i>,  is based on [PVZ2PAK](https://github.com/jiangnangame/PVZ2PAK), which is the best mod of PVZ1 which restores PVZ2 by [JiangNanGame](http://www.jiangnangame.com) . 

In December, 2022, we continued to make this work and used Plants vs. Zombies: Game of the Year as the main program. PVZ2PAK:GOTY will reset the Zombatar, Achievements System in PVZ2 style and restore some Animations, Particles and other details in PVZ2.  

As mentioned before, PVZ2PAK and PVZ2PAK:GOTY is free. We welcome everyone who follows [The Changjiang River License](https://github.com/jiangnangame/The-Changjiang-River-License) to improve it after we stop updating and maintaining it.

Different from the old, a new [Costume Changer](https://github.com/jiangnangame/PVZ2PAK-Changer) is designed to change the costumes of plants and zombies in PVZ2PAK:GOTY.

We developed PVZ2PAK:GOTY only for learning purposes. You must not use the program for commercial purposes, otherwise the legal issues should be resolved by yourself.
